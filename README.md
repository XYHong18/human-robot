# human-robot

This project develops a human-robot system that consists of an RGB-D camera, a robotic arm, and a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The most important feature of the system is the waypoint control function that enables a human operator to command the robotic arm to approach a target location by directly clicking on the corresponding pixel in a camera view.
